# W3C Solid Community Group Meeting Guidelines

To reach consensus where no consensus has been reached before.

It is recommended that meetings adopt the guidelines in this document as well as the [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/) where applicable.

The [Solid Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) and [Positive Work Environment at W3C: Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/) must be followed by all meeting participants.

## Meeting Recordings and Transcripts

No audio or video recording, or automated transcripts without consent. Meetings are transcribed and made public. If consent is withheld by anyone, recording/retention must not occur.

There is a [minutes template](https://github.com/solid/specification/blob/main/meetings/template.md) (Markdown) that can be used.

Steps to publishing minutes:

1. Minutes state publication status. Initially set to "Draft".
2. Push minutes to the main branch of relevant repository.
3. Announce minutes URL.
4. Improvements to the minutes can be PR'd.
5. Approve minutes in a future meeting. Change minutes' publication status to "Published". Merge minutes in PR if there is one, otherwise update the main branch.
